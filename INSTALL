-------
Preface
-------

This is still a experimental piece of code to test the viability of the
B.A.T.M.A.N routing algorithm based on initial ideas of Thomas Lopatic
and Corinna 'Elektra' Aichele.

This is implementation 0.1-rc0 of the improved B.A.T.M.A.N-III algorithm. It
is not unlikely that we have to fix some bugs.

Use - like always - at your own risk!


--------
Features
--------

Improved B.A.T.M.A.N-III algorithm 
Free-BSD support 
Mac OS-X support
IP-Tunnels 
Gateway detection 
Multiple Interfaces support
Support for a server that collects link-state information from each node to generate two
dimensional or three dimensional topology graphs.


-------
Roadmap
-------

So far IP-Tunnels use TCP in TCP - which is known to have bad performance
when links are lossy. We are going to move to UDP for the IP-Tunnels.

Testing, improvements in the documentation. 

Develop B.A.T.M.A.N-Advanced that routes on Layer 2 and creates a Link-Local-Illusion for higher
OSI-Layers

Read speed tables from WiFi-Cards to calculate the transfer speed of routes
in B.A.T.M.A.N-Advanced


------------
Requirements
------------

Linux with kernel-module 'tun' loaded if you want to use/be a gateway
FreeBSD
MacOS-X

------------
Installation
------------

You need the usual working environment to compile software. In the
B.A.T.M.A.N directory type

make <press enter>

After the compilation process is finished you'll find a executable called 'batman'. This
executable is quite big because it is not stripped.

Strip it by performing:

strip batman <press enter>

Note there is no installation script at the moment. If you want to install
it, copy the deamon to a location somewhere in your path, for example
/usr/sbin or /usr/local/bin.



---
Use
---


Make sure you have no firewall running that is blocking UDP port 1966. 
Type in the B.A.T.M.A.N source-directory:

./batman -H


Usage: batman [options] interface [interface interface]

       -d debug level
          default: 0, allowed values: 0 - 3

       -g gateway class

	  Use this feature if you want to offer a internet gateway and tell
	  clients what kind of gateway you are!

          default:         0 -> this is not an internet gateway
          allowed values:  1 -> modem line
                           2 -> ISDN line
                           3 -> double ISDN
                           4 -> 256 KBit
                           5 -> UMTS / 0.5 MBit
                           6 -> 1 MBit
                           7 -> 2 MBit
                           8 -> 3 MBit
                           9 -> 5 MBit
                          10 -> 6 MBit
                          11 -> >6 MBit

       -h shorter help
       -H this help


       -o orginator interval in ms
          default: 1000, allowed values: >0

       -p preferred gateway

	  This will set up an IP-Tunnel to the destination IP

          default: none, allowed values: IP

       -r routing class (only needed if gateway class = 0)

	  If you are a client, this will select the way you choose an
	  internet-gateway

          default:         0 -> set no default route
          allowed values:  1 -> use fast internet connection
                           2 -> use stable internet connection
                           3 -> use best statistic internet connection (olsr style)

       -s visualisation server

	  The Server-IP that collects the topology information for
	  topology-visualisation

          default: none, allowed values: IP




Switch the output of runtime debugging messages to a low level if you want
to test the software on a slow system.

We would love to see B.A.T.M.A.N in a match against other routing protocols
in existing mesh networks. You can set up a virtual interface on an
interface that you run another mesh routing protocol on.

If, for example, you have olsrd running on interface wlan0 with IP address
104.30.30.30 you could set up a virtual interface wlan0:0 with another
IP-address within another network:

ifconfig wlan0:0 103.30.30.30 netmask 255.0.0.0 broadcast 103.255.255.255

./batman wlan0:0

Now you can check out which protocol works better.

Happy routing!
